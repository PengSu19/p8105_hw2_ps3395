# Problem 1

### To merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys across datasets

First clean the pols-month data, which with 822 observations and 9
variables. Separated the `mon` into `year`, `month`, and day and mapped
month into strings. Then create a `president` variable taking values
`gop` and `dem`, and remove `prez_dem`, `prez_gop`, and the `day`
variable.

``` r
#clean the data in pols-month.csv
pols_month = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-", convert = T) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop"),
    month = month.name[month]) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez"))
```

Secondly, for cleaning the snp.csv using a similar process to the above.

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv("data/snp.csv",
           col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    year = if_else(year>2023,year-100,year),
    month = month.name[month]) |>
  select(year, month, close) 
```

Third, tidy the unemployment data

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )


unemployment = 
  read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

Finally merge three datasets

``` r
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols_month, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)
```

Notice that there are some `NA` values in the `close` and `unemployment`
variables, which indicate that the value of these variables is missing
at those locations.

Let’s talk about the 538 datasets. The `pols_month` data has 822
observations and 9 variables and tells us about the party affiliation
distribution (democrat or republican) for governors and senators for a
given year from years 1947 to 2015. It also tells us whether the sitting
president was a democrat or republican. The `snp` data has 787
observations and 3 variables, ranging from years 1950 to 2015. The
`unemployment` data has 816 observations and 3 variables ranging from
years 1948 to 2015. In Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was
president, the **average unemployment rate was 6.57**. The average
unemployment rate over the same time period in which a republican was
president was 6.47.

# Problem 2

### Read and clean data from *“202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx”*

``` r
#Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet
Mr_trash = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1 ) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(homes_powered = round ((weight_tons * 500) / 30, 0),
         trashID = "Mr",
         year = as.numeric(year))|>
  select(-x15,-x16)

#Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda
professor_trash = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 2 ) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster)|>
  mutate(homes_powered = round ((weight_tons * 500) / 30, 0),
         trashID = "professor",
         year = as.numeric(year))

gwynnda_trash = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 4) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster)|>
  mutate(homes_powered = round ((weight_tons * 500) / 30, 0),
         trashID = "gwynnda",
         year = as.numeric(year))

merge_trash = bind_rows(Mr_trash, professor_trash,gwynnda_trash)
```

### Description

Three datasets are involved in Problem 2, including *“Mr.”*,
*“Professor”* and *“Gwynnda”* Trash Wheel. Which containing 584, 106,
and 155 observations respectively. Moreover, there are common variables
involved in these three datasets, such as,

- `month`, `year` and `date` for recording the time.
- `weight_tons` and `volume_cubic_yards` represent the weights and
  volumes of the trash.
- `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene` and `cigarette_butts` indicate trash
  amount in different types.
- `homes_powered` represents the average time that electricity converted
  from garbage can be used by a household.

Then merging these three datasets into one dataframe called
*“merge_trash”*, which contains 845 observations and 15 variables.

For available data, the total weight of trash collected by Professor
Trash Wheel was 216.26 tons, and the total number of cigarette butts
collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 was 16,300.

# Problem 3

### Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of baseline demographics

``` r
#import and clean the MCI baseline data
mci_baseline_na =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1, na = ".") |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  mutate(
    sex = 
      case_match(
        sex, 
        1 ~ "male", 
        0 ~ "female"),
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    apoe4 = 
      case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "carrier", 
        0 ~ "non_carrier"),
    apoe4 = as.factor(apoe4)
      )

#remove the participates 
mci_baseline = filter(mci_baseline_na,current_age< age_at_onset| is.na(age_at_onset))

mci_baseline_finall = drop_na(mci_baseline)
```

### Data import steps and features

In order to have a tidy MCI baseline data, firstly, read the raw data
from relative paths with `.` in “Age at onset” transformed to `NA`, and
applied `janitor::clean_names()` to rename the variables.

Secondly, `mutate` function was performed to label the sex and APOE4
carrier status for participants, for `sex`, “1” represented “Male” while
“0” represented “Female”, and for `apoe4`, “1” indicated “APOE4 carrier”
while “0” indicated “APOE4 non_carrier”. Then these two variables were
transformed to factors.

In addition, as the study was focused on the MCI, participants who did
not have MCI at the baseline do not meet the stated inclusion criteria
and were removed by `filter` function. After all cleaning steps, only
479 observations remained with 6 variables. Then filter the participants
that did not develop MCI at the end, and finally only 93 participants

In conclusion, 483 participants were recruited, and only 93 of these
developed MCI at the end. Furthermore, the average baseline age is 65.03
and there are 30% of women in the study carried APOE4.

### Similarly, import, clean, and tidy the dataset of longitudinally observed biomarker values

``` r
#import and clean the MCI baseline data
mci_amyloid =
  read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1, na = "NA") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  filter(baseline != "Na")|>
  select(id = study_id , baseline,
         year2 = time_2, year4 = time_4,year6 = time_6, year8 = time_8, 
         everything())|>
  pivot_longer(
    baseline:year8,
    names_to = "ob_year", 
    values_to = "ratio") 
```

### Data import steps and features

Similarly, `read_csv` was applied to import *amyloid* data and
`janitor::clean_names()` function was used to tidy the column names. In
addition, in order to compare with baseline data, `study_id` in amyloid
data was changed to `id`. Then transformed the dataset to long data, and
changed `time_` variables to `year_` variables. For the dataset of
longitudinally observed biomarker values, it contains 485 participants
and 3 variables, which including `id` for each participants and
`baseline` that represents the time (years) elapsed since the study
baseline to the visit where biomarker Amyloid \_ 42/40 ratio was
measured.

### check difference

``` r
# Check for participants appearing only in the baseline dataset
participants_only_in_baseline <- mci_baseline |>
  anti_join(mci_amyloid, by = "id")


# Check for participants appearing only in the amyloid dataset
participants_only_in_amyloid <- mci_amyloid |>
  anti_join(mci_baseline, by = "id")
```

### Comment

Comparing cleaned baseline and amyloid datasets, there are 9
participants appearing only in the baseline data, and 15 participants
only in amyloid data.

### merge data

``` r
# combined two dataset and only contains participants that appearing in both datasets.
merge_mci = 
  inner_join(mci_baseline, mci_amyloid,by = "id") 

#save data
write.csv(merge_mci,"data/merge_mci.csv" ,row.names = F)
```

### Description

After combining baseline and amyloid data with participants that
appearing in both datasets, which is 470, the merging dataset
*“merge_mci”* finally includes 2350 observations with 8 variables that
from two datasets.
