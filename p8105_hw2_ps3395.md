#### Description

Three datasets are involved in Problem 2, including *“Mr.”*,
*“Professor”* and *“Gwynnda”* Trash Wheel. Which containing 547, 94, and
106 observations respectively. Moreover, there are 11 common variables
involved in these three datasets, such as

- `month`, `year` and `date` for recording the time.
- `weight_tons` and `volume_cubic_yards` represent the weights and
  volumes of the trash.
- `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene` and `cigarette_butts` indicate trash
  amount in different types.
- `homes_powered` represents the average time that electricity converted
  from garbage can be used by a household.

Then merging these three datasets into one dataframe called
*“merge_trash”*, which contains 747 observations and 19 variables.

For available data, the total weight of trash collected by Professor
Trash Wheel was 190.12 tons, and the total number of cigarette butts
collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 was 16,300.
